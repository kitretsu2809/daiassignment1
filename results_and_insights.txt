------Observations:

    Columns: rank, discipline, yrs.since.phd, yrs.service, sex, salary.
    Data types: rank, discipline, sex are categorical (object), while yrs.since.phd, yrs.service, salary are numerical (int64).
    The dataset has 397 rows (based on the index from 1 to 397).

-----Handling Missing Values
    Results:

    Before Imputation:
        yrs.since.phd: 2 missing.
        yrs.service: 3 missing.
        salary: 6 missing.
    After Imputation: No missing values remain.
    Medians Used (computed from non-missing data):
        yrs.since.phd: ~22.
        yrs.service: ~17.
        salary: ~113,543.

------Removing Duplicates
    Result: No duplicate rows found in the dataset.


------Detecting and Treating Outliers
    Results (approximate, based on data):

    yrs.since.phd: ~5 outliers (e.g., 56 in row 351).
    yrs.service: ~4 outliers (e.g., 60 in row 331).
    salary: ~10 outliers (e.g., 231,545 in row 44).

    Decision: Outliers are plausible (senior professors with long careers or high salaries), so they are retained.

--------Standardizing Categorical Values
    Result:

    rank: ['Prof', 'AsstProf', 'AssocProf'] – consistent.
    discipline: ['B', 'A'] – consistent.
    sex: ['Male', 'Female'] – consistent.

    No inconsistencies or typos detected.

######Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)#######
---------Univariate Analysis

    Analyze each variable individually.
    Numerical Variables

    Examine summary statistics and distributions.

    Results and Insights:

    Years Since PhD:
        Mean: 22.31, Median: 21, Range: 1–56.
        Skewness: 0.46 (slightly right-skewed).
        Most values cluster between 10–40 years.
    Years of Service:
        Mean: 17.61, Median: 16, Range: 0–60.
        Skewness: 0.64 (moderately right-skewed).
        Many faculty have <20 years of service, with a tail of longer-serving individuals.
    Salary:
        Mean: 113,706, Median: 113,543, Range: 57,800–231,545.
        Skewness: 0.71 (moderately right-skewed).
        Salaries cluster around 80,000–150,000, with a few high earners.

--------Categorical Variables
    Results and Insights:

    Rank:
        Prof: 67%, AsstProf: 17%, AssocProf: 16%.
        Professors dominate the dataset.
    Discipline:
        B: 54%, A: 46%.
        Slightly more faculty in discipline B.
    Sex:
        Male: 90%, Female: 10%.
        Significant gender imbalance, with males heavily overrepresented.

--------Bivariate Analysis

Explore relationships between pairs of variables.
Numerical-Numerical Relationships

Examine correlations and scatter plots.
    Results and Insights:

    Correlation Matrix:
        yrs.since.phd vs. yrs.service: 0.91 (very strong positive correlation).
        yrs.since.phd vs. salary: 0.42 (moderate positive correlation).
        yrs.service vs. salary: 0.33 (weak positive correlation).
    Scatter Plot: Weak positive trend between yrs.since.phd and salary, with considerable variability (e.g., some with 40+ years earn less than those with 20 years).

C-------------ategorical-Numerical Relationships
    Results and Insights:

    Rank vs. Salary:
        Prof: Median ~120,000, Range: 57,800–231,545.
        AssocProf: Median ~97,000, Range: 62,884–126,431.
        AsstProf: Median ~80,000, Range: 63,100–97,032.
        Professors have significantly higher salaries, with more outliers.
    Sex vs. Salary:
        Male: Median ~113,000, Range: 57,800–231,545.
        Female: Median ~109,650, Range: 63,100–161,101.
        Similar medians, but males have more high outliers.

---------Categorical-Categorical Relationships
    Insight: Males dominate all ranks (Prof: 238M/28F, AssocProf: 57M/7F, AsstProf: 62M/5F), especially among Professors.


-----------Multivariate Analysis

-------Examine interactions among multiple variables.
        Pair Plots

--------Visualize relationships with a categorical hue.
    Insight: Professors have higher yrs.since.phd, yrs.service, and salary, with distinct separation from Assistant and Associate Professors in numerical variables.

----------Grouped Comparisons

    Analyze combined effects using a pivot table.
    Results and Insights:

    Prof: Male: 117,865, Female: 122,876 (females earn more on average).
    AssocProf: Male: 94,624, Female: 95,256 (similar).
    AsstProf: Male: 83,167, Female: 81,885 (males slightly higher).
    Female Professors earn more, possibly due to small sample size (28 females vs. 238 males).
